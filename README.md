- Write clear meaningful git commit messages
- Make sure your PR's description contains GitHub's special keyword references that automatically close the related issue when the PR is merged. 
- When you make very very minor changes to a PR of yours (like for example fixing a text in button, minor changes requested by reviewers) make sure you squash your commits afterward so that you don't have too many commits for a very small fix.
- When you're submitting a PR for a UI-related issue, it would be really awesome if you add a screenshot of your change or a link to a deployment where it can be tested out along with your PR. It makes it very easy for the reviewers and you'll also get reviews quicker.
